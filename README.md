This is an app I made when I was 17 in 2018 as a joke for a Computer Science class. Sham Allows the user to fake notifications with the intent to gain social influence. All assets were produced by me aside from the stock photos of people seen in the screenshots and the fire png file. The introduction screen was not created by me and taken from a tutorial linked in the associated class and xml file. This was only because I needed to quickly produce an introduction for the app in a short time frame. Sham was originally published on the Google Play store in June of 2018; however, taken down due to compatibility bugs. These could have been easily solved; however, I lacked motivation to fully complete the project as it started off as a joke and I truly only made it to get a better grasp of Android Studio.
